Introns dataset from GENCODE release 27 and GENCODE m16

This dataset of introns data was used for the paper "Unique features of GC-AG splice junctions revealed by comparison of human and mouse long non-coding and protein-coding genes".

The dataset include the lists of human and mouse lncRNA and protein-coding introns describing introns coordinates, gene and transcript IDs and the donor and acceptor splice sites.
